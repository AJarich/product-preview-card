# Frontend Mentor - Results Summary Component Exercise

This is my solution to the Product Preview Card Component on Front End Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa/hub).

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge is to make the Product Preview Card Component as close to the images as possible. The component is going to be responsive, with a different look
for both desktop and mobile. The button should change color when hovered over, too;

## My Process

### Built With

-- HTML5

-- CSS3

-- Flexbox

-- Google Fonts

### What I Learned

I was able to practice using the flexbox in this project. I used flexbox in many situations. It helped me when the component changed from a horizontal row in
desktop to a vertical column in mobile.

I also learned about the text decoration of line-through for the old price.

### Continued Development

In the future, I would want to try to use React.js to create this project.

### Helpful Links

-- [Resource 1](https://youtu.be/S8HgWe3_VYg) - This can help figure out how to center div in the middle of the screen.

-- [Resource 2](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to use different fonts other than the default web-safe fonts you get.
